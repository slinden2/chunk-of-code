This post will be one that I will update in the future when I find new interesting and useful extensions. For now I have three of them that I totally love and use all the time.

## Git History

This is a huge time saver. It allows you to quickly check the previous commits of a file. Often I am working on a file and I need something that I remember that was already included in that file some time back. I can just quickly hit `ctrl + shift + P` and write `view file history`. The extensions gives me a list of commits done to that file and I can compare difference commits with the current file.

If you haven't used [Git History](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.githistory), I definitely suggest you to take a look at this.

## Bracket Pair Colorizer

Are you having hard time to keep on track on your nested code blocks? The cure for the disease is [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer). It neatly gives different colors to your code blocks so that you can easily identify which code block are you in and which code block is around the current block and so on.

## ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets

This is a no-brainer if you work with React. [ES7 snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets) gives a nice little boost to your productivity as it helps you to insert quickly some nicely formatted code in your files. Some of the snippets that I use **all the time ** are:

- rafc - Inserts a correctly named functional component using the filename as the name of the component. This is definitely the most useful one for me.
- clg - Gives you a `console.log` that I, and you should too, use all the time for debugging purposes.
- fof - This inserts a `for of` loop. With React and functional programming paradigm you don't need traditional loops all that much, but the times you do, this is the shortcut for it.
